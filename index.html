        <h2>Jamila McLymont</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Jamila but most people refer to me as 'Jam', 'Mila' or 'J'.
            I am currently 21 years old and I enjoy reading fiction, playing video games and watching shows.
            In addition to that, I do enjoy going to the beach at nights, trying new restaurants and being anywhere where there is peace and nature.
            I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing as I enjoy coding and writing fiction. I am open-minded, a bit introverted and very adaptive.
            I chose Computer Science as a major and Web Development as a course because I love gaming and have always been interested in building one on my own. In addition to that, 
            I have also been fascinated by how websites work and the intricate process of bringing ideas to life through code. 
            Web Development allows me to combine both logical problem-solving and artistic design. I am eager to learn more and build web experiences that are both functional and visually appealing.
            I am pursuing this degree with the intention of being a Game or Web Developer in the future.
